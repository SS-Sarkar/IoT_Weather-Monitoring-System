🌦️ Weather Monitoring System (WMS) 🌡️☀️🌧️

The Weather Monitoring System (WMS) is a comprehensive project that utilizes various sensors to monitor weather conditions and sends the collected data to the Blynk server. The system incorporates the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), and a rain sensor to provide real-time weather information.

Features:
🌡️ Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: The DHT11 sensor measures temperature and humidity levels, providing accurate and up-to-date readings.

☀️ Light Intensity Detection: The LDR sensor allows monitoring of the ambient light intensity, helping to determine the brightness of the environment and with this we can see it is night or day.

🌧️ Rain Detection: The rain sensor detects rainfall, enabling the system to provide information about weather conditions.

📡 Blynk Integration: The collected sensor data is sent to the Blynk server, allowing users to access the information remotely through the WMS app created using MIT App Inventor and the Blynk mobile app.

The WMS app, developed using MIT App Inventor, provides a user-friendly interface to display the weather data collected from the sensors. Users can conveniently access temperature, humidity, light intensity,Day night cycle, rain in percentage, date and time directly on their smartphones.

To set up the system, I followed these steps:

a).  Connected the DHT11, LDR, and rain sensor to the Arduino board as per the pin connections provided in the code.

b).  Installed the necessary libraries for DHT11, LDR, and Blynk in the Arduino IDE.

c).  Created a Blynk account and obtain the required Blynk authentication token.

d).  Configured the Blynk app and map the virtual pins to the respective sensor readings.

e).  Flashed the Arduino with the code to collect data from the sensors and send it to the Blynk server.

f).  Created the WMS app using MIT App Inventor.

g).  Downloaded and installed the WMS app on my smartphone using the APK file or we can compile it using the MIT App Inventor.

h).  Also downloaded the Blynk mobile app

With the WMS or Blynk app, we can stay informed about the weather conditions in real-time, whether we're at home or on the go. Get ready to explore the WMS app and experience a new level of weather monitoring!
